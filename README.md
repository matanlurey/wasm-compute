## Requirements

This repository was only setup and tested on an ARM64 Mac running macOS Sonoma (14.3).

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then run:

```shell
brew bundle install
rustup-init
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo install viceroy
```

If this is your first time using Fastly, you will need to [create an account](https://www.fastly.com/signup/).

## Examples

### Frictions

There were some friction points I encountered while setting up this repository.

- Difficult to understand pricing and limits for Compute, _"Call Sales"_?

- When I signed up for an account I interpreted the required field "company"
  accidentally as _employer_, and it loosk like I'll have to contact support to
  change it (as I get an _Invalid request_ error when trying to update it).

- There are [API tokens](https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens)
  created called `manage.fastly.com browser session` that I never created, and
  I'm not sure if they are safe to delete or what they are for.

- When using `fastly profile create`, and I'm asked for an API key, the prompt
  says _Fastly API token:_, but the input is hidden, so it was hard to know if
  I was copy-pasting the correct value or not (<https://github.com/fastly/cli/issues/1184>).

- I eventually created one, but it was _wrong_ beacuse I created a "Read only token" (<https://github.com/fastly/cli/issues/1185>).

- When I tried creating a _global_ token, I got an error: _You must POST /sudo
  to access this endpoint_. Eventually it worked several minutes later.
